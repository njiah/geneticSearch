## Finding the most compatible pairs using Genetic Algorithm.

### Description
This algorithm is to find pairs with the best scores for the [matchmaking algorithm](NSA.py), created for [Bristol ABACUS](https://www.instagram.com/bristolabacus?igsh=emdoaTJnczJxcGo5)'s **No Strings Attached** event.

### Run
```python
ga = GA()
best_score, best_pair = ga.run()
```
A pair with the best compatible score can be found within 5 generations.
Results can be found [here](search.ipynb).
